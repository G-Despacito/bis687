## Introduction

This repository is for BIS 687 - Data Science Capstone Project. Our team tries to use UK Biobank data set to investigate the following _research question_:
> Among older adults aged 65+, how does spending time on television and computer for more than 4 hours, compared to less than 4 hours, affect their diet quality and then further influence their overall health.

We split the research question into two _specific aims_:
> Specific Aims 1. To investigate the association between time spent on television or computer among older adults and their dietary quality.
> Specific Aims 2. To investigate the association between dietary quality and overall health among older adults aged 65+.

Further details can be found in the project proposal document.
